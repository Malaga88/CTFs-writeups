# 🚩 CTF & Hacking Writeups

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository documents my journey through various penetration testing labs, including **Proving Grounds**, **Hack The Box**, and **TryHackMe**.

All writeups include the full exploitation chain:
- **Reconnaissance** (Nmap, Enumeration)
- **Initial Access** (CVEs, Exploits)
- **Privilege Escalation** (Linux/Windows)

## 📂 Proving Grounds (OffSec)

| Machine Name | Difficulty | OS | Key Techniques Used | Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [DC-1](./DC-1_Walkthrough.md) | Easy | Linux | Drupalgeddon2, SUID Abuse (find), Hash Cracking | Nov 2025 |
| FunboxEasy | Easy | Linux | *Pending...* | *Coming Soon* |

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
* **Network Scanning:** Nmap
* **Exploitation:** Metasploit, Python scripting
* **Privilege Escalation:** SUID binaries, Kernel exploits
* **Web Security:** SQL Injection, CMS Vulnerabilities (Drupal, WordPress)
